# Practice Application

Read below to run a developement server or tests for this web application. This is a test application to understand the basics of how Angular runs under the hood.

## Steps to Start Application
1. install node using this website [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/)
2. Install dependencies running npm install ``` npm install ```

Then follow the steps below to utilize the Angular CLI.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
